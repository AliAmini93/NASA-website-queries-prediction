# NASA website queries prediction

Here, we forecast the amount of queries to the NASA website. After fitting an MLP to the dataset, the neural network weights are retrieved. These weights are optimized using three distinct optimization algorithms: grey wolf optimization (GWO), particle swarm intelligence (PSO), and imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA). Using these three techniques, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) on the test set is seen to decrease.
